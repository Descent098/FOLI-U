# Usage & More information

## Running and Compiling
To compile and run the program, use the "runProgram" script if you're on Linux or the "runProgram windows" script if you are on Windows. 

## Running Without Compiling
There is also the option to use the "runProgram(no compile)" script if you have already compiled the code previously (for windows). If the regular "runProgram" script is ran it will compile the program and launch Program.class. 

## Test Code

Contextual information on the tests will only appear if the tests fail. If all tests pass for a specific class a message will print to the console saying "All Tests for <classname> passed".
